Mighty HQ Privacy Policy
Last updated: October 17, 2023

This Privacy Policy describes how Mighty HQ (referred to as "we," "our," or "us") collects, stores, uses, discloses, and processes personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") in the course of our business, including our website located at www.mightyhq.com (the "Website") and our All-in-One Ads Platform made available via the Website for purposes of managing, monitoring, and executing marketing campaigns, along with all other Mighty HQ services, technology, data, programs, and materials. The Website, our Platform, and the other services and related offerings are collectively referred to as the “Services.”

Protecting your privacy is important to us. We are fully committed to ensuring that our practices concerning your Personal Information are fair and transparent. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and make sure you understand and agree to it. By accessing and using the Website or other Services, you acknowledge that you have read this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by all terms and conditions. If you do not agree to abide by this Privacy Policy, or if you do not wish to provide your Personal Information or have it processed by us or any of our affiliates or service providers, please do not access or use the Website or other Services.

Terms that are capitalized and not defined in this Privacy Policy are explained in our Terms of Service Agreement, which can be found at https://mightyhq.com/terms or any successor URL ("Agreement"). Please review the Agreement because it also governs your access and use of the Services.

**1. Automatic Collection of Personal Information**

**General:** We prioritize customer data security and maintain a "no logs" policy. This means we do not store logs or records of your online activity, and we only process as much Personal Information as is absolutely necessary to operate the Services. Any automatically collected Personal Information is used only to identify potential cases of abuse or to establish usage and traffic statistics about the Services. This statistical information is not aggregated in a way that identifies a specific user.

**Cookies:** We may use "cookies" to automatically collect statistical information through the Website and Services and to personalize your online experience. (A cookie is a small text file placed in your device browser and uniquely assigned to you to store your preferences.) Most web browsers allow you to block and delete cookies; however, please note that doing so may affect the proper functioning of the Website and Services. For more information about the cookies we may use and how we use them, please refer to our Cookie Policy at https://mightyhq.com/cookie-policy.

**Do Not Track:** Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. Nevertheless, as described in more detail throughout this Privacy Policy, we limit our use and collection of your Personal Information.

**2. Optional Personal Information**

You can generally access and use the Website and Services without revealing Personal Information by which someone could identify you. However, to access specific features, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name and email address. You may choose not to provide this information, but please note that without it, we may be unable to provide the full range of our Services and the best user experience. When you knowingly provide Personal Information to us, such as when you create a Mighty HQ Services account or complete online forms on our Website, we receive and store such information. We may also collect other Personal Information about you from third-party sources, such as public databases and our joint marketing partners. If you are uncertain about which Personal Information is optional or mandatory to use the Website and Services, please contact us at support@mightyhq.com.

**3. Use and Processing of Information**

To make the Website and Services fully available to you, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information, we may not be able to provide you with all requested products or services. The information we collect from you may be used to help us operate the Website and Services, measure interest and engagement, improve, troubleshoot, or develop the Services, ensure quality control and safety, carry out audits, communicate with you about your account, your activities on our Services, and policy changes, prevent or prosecute prohibited or illegal activities, enforce our agreements, and comply with our legal obligations.

How we process Personal Information depends on (a) how you interact with the Website and Services, (b) where you are located in the world, and (c) whether one of the following applies:

- You have given your consent to process the information for one or more specific purposes (except as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) or European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)).
- Providing the information is necessary for us to perform or fulfill our agreement with you.
- The processing is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation.
- The processing is related to a task we carry out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us.
- The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests that we or a third party pursue.

Please note that under some laws, we may be allowed to process information until you object (by opting out) without relying on consent or any other legal basis. In any case, we will clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and whether providing Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

We may use Personal Information and other data to create de-identified and/or aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the device from which you access our Services, or other analyses. De-identified and/or aggregated information is not considered Personal Information, and we may use and disclose such information for research, internal analysis, analytics, and any other legally permissible purposes.

**4. Managing Information**

You may delete certain Personal Information that we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Website and Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the period necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners and for the purposes described herein. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your Mighty HQ account, you may do so on the settings page of your account on the Website.

**5. Disclosure of Information**

To maintain the highest level of privacy and protect your Personal Information, we do not share your Personal Information with anyone or for any reason.

**6. Retention of Information**

We (and our authorized service providers) will store and use the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use the Website or Services or as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which the information was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes (as required by applicable record-keeping laws), establish legal defenses, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws. Except as required by applicable law or our agreements with you, we are not obligated to retain Personal Information for any particular period and may securely delete or restrict access to it for any reason and at any time, with or without notice. If you have questions about our data retention policy or wish to request that we stop processing or delete your Personal Data (see GDPR section below), please contact us by email at support@mightyhq.com.

**7. Transfer of Information**



Depending on your location, data transfers may involve storing your information in a country other than your own, including, but not limited to, the United States. As explained in further detail herein, we strive to safeguard your information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. You have the right to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to protect your information. If you have questions about any such transfers, please contact us by email at support@mightyhq.com.

**8. Data Protection Rights Under GDPR**

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, Mighty HQ acts as the "controller" in respect of certain Personal Data (as defined under the GDPR), such as account registration details, that we collect directly from you and other users of the Services and that we use for the purposes of our business. You are the "controller" of your other Personal Data, and we act as the data "processor," processing such Personal Data on your behalf per your instructions.

Under GDPR, the main legal bases we rely on to process Personal Data collected by the Services include the following:

- Necessary for entering into or performing an agreement.
- Necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.
- Necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests.
- Consent in some circumstances.

As noted herein, we may share your Personal Data with trusted third parties to provide services requested by you or our clients and to perform maintenance or respond to technical issues involving the Services. We require minimum standards of confidentiality and data protection when we disclose Personal Data to third parties.

If your Personal Data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will ensure that approved safeguards are in place to comply with GDPR, such as the European Commission's approved standard contractual clauses. In limited circumstances, transfers of Personal Data may be based on context-specific derogations that permit transfers in the absence of safeguards, such as when a transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

As noted above, we will retain your Personal Data for the time necessary to provide the Services or to achieve other purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. To request that we stop processing or delete your Personal Data, please contact us by email at support@mightyhq.com.

You have the following rights in relation to Personal Data we hold about you, which you may exercise by emailing us at support@mightyhq.com. We may require evidence of your identity before acting on your request:

- Right to request confirmation of whether we are processing your Personal Data.
- Right to request a copy of your Personal Data. We may refuse your request in whole or in part for good reason and, if we do, we will provide our reasons for the refusal.
- Right to receive an electronic copy of Personal Data processed by automated means in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
- Right to object to or restrict our uses of your Personal Data.
- Right to seek correction or amendment of inaccurate, untrue, outdated, or incomplete Personal Data.
- Right to request erasure of your Personal Data.
- Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that our processing of your Personal Data violates applicable law.

**9. California Privacy Rights**

This section applies only to our processing of Personal Information subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) or the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”). California residents have the right to know what categories of Personal Information we have collected about them, whether we have disclosed that Personal Information for a business purpose in the past 12 months, and how long we retain the Personal Information. You can find this information below:

[Provide table of categories, collection, disclosure, third parties, and retention periods as per the CCPA/CPRA]

In addition to the rights under GDPR listed above, California residents may contact us to request deletion or correction of their Personal Information. To the extent that we may use data profiling technology, California residents have the right to learn about that technology and opt-out of us using their information for profiling purposes.

**10. How to Exercise Your Rights**

To exercise your rights, please contact us as indicated on the Website, or you may email us at support@mightyhq.com. Your request should include sufficient details to allow us to properly understand and respond to it. We may ask you to verify your identity with sufficient information before responding to your request.

**11. Privacy of Children**

The Website and Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children. If you learn that your child has provided Personal Information to us without your consent, please contact us at support@mightyhq.com or as otherwise provided below. If we learn that we have collected a child’s Personal Information in violation of applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account.

**12. Links to Other Resources**

The Website and Services may contain links to other websites/applications, and other websites/applications may reference or link to us. We do not control these third-party services. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and other applicable terms and policies of each third-party website and application. We do not endorse, screen, or approve, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices or content of such other websites or applications. You provide Personal Information to third-party websites or applications at your own risk.

**13. Information Security**

We secure Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be fully guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge:

- The Internet has some security and privacy limitations beyond our control.
- We cannot guarantee the security, integrity, and privacy of information and data exchanged between you and the Website and Services.
- Despite our best efforts, a third party may view or tamper with any such information and data while in transit.

**14. Data Breach**

If we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or that users’ Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties due to external activity, such as security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take appropriate measures, including investigation, reporting, and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. If a data breach occurs and we believe there is a reasonable risk of harm to affected users or if notice is otherwise required by law, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals, either by posting a notice on the Website or Services or by sending an email.

**15. Changes and Amendments**

We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you continue to use the Website or Services after the new Privacy Policy takes effect. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different from what was stated when your Personal Information was collected.
